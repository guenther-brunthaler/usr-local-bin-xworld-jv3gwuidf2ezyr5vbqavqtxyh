	$APP -
	   mount or unmount encfs

	$APP is an enfcs helper utility. ("encfs" is a popular encrypted
	filesystem in userspace based on the "fuse" kernel module.)

	$APP mounts an encrypted encfs container on a mount point directory
	for the current user. Alternatively, $APP can unmount a mounted
	directory.

	And because directories in EncFS cannot be used as mount points for
	nested encrypted filesystems, $APP also supports following symlinks
	from the actual mount-point directories somewhere else.

	It also supports setting up such external mount points and creating a
	symlink to them automatically, using a randomly-generated mount point
	name which does not reveal anything to an observer when the mount
	point is not currently in use.

	Usage: $APP
	   [ options ... ] [ <directory> [ <mount_point_base_dir> ] ]

	where

	<directory>: Either the mount point directory or the encrypted encfs
	container directory ending in ".encfs". If <directory> is not
	specified, then there must exist exactly one *.encfs subdirectory (or
	symlink) in the current directory, and it will automatically be used
	as <directory>. This will not work if multiple *.encfs directories are
	present. In this case, it is necessary to specify <directory>
	explicitly. If the base name of <directory> has a .encfs suffix, it is
	assumed to be an encrypted encfs container directory. Otherwise, it is
	considered to be the mount point directory. In either case, both
	directories must exist: <name> and <name>.encfs, and <directory> may
	specify either of them. The mount-point directory can also be a
	symlink to some other directory. In this case, the decrypted view into
	the encrypted filesystem will be mounted where this symlink points to.
	Neither <name> nor <name>.encfs need to exist. They will be created in
	the current directory if not already existing, allowing access to the
	current user only.

	<mount_point_base_dir>: This is only relevant if the <name> specified
	by <directory> does not yet exist and will be ignored otherwise. Its
	presence modifies the behavior described for <directory> in this case.
	<name>.encfs will still be created in the current directory if not
	present, but <name> will be created as a relative symlink instead,
	referring to a automatically created new mount point (requires the -f
	option to be specified though) created as a sub-directory of
	<mount_point_base_dir> with a randomly-generated name.

	--force, -f: Enforce automatic creating of missing mount-point
	directories. This used to be the default in earlier versions of $APP
	but led to accidental creation of mount point due to incorrect
	arguments directories too often.

	--urandom, -u: This is only relevant for generating a mount point name
	randomly, as described in the section about <mount_point_base_dir>.
	Without, this option /dev/random will be used as source for the random
	name. This option changes this to using /dev/urandom instead. This
	option implies --force.
	
	--timeout=<delay>, -t<delay>: Try to unmount the on-the-fly decryption
	of the encrypted file system after a delay of <delay> without activity
	(modifications; just having files opened for reading does not count as
	actitity). Normally, the on-the-fly decryption remains mounted until
	unmounted explicitly. The <delay> is can either be specified as a
	number of hours (if less than 15) or as a number of minutes (15 or
	more). Alternatively, the number can be suffixed (without a separating
	space) by an explicit specifier for the time unit to be used: "m" for
	minutes, "h" for hours (60 minutes) or "d" for days (24 hours).

	--help, -h: Show this usage help.

	--version, -V: Show the version of this script.

	--non-empty, --nonempty, --ne, -e: Allow the mount point directory to
	be non-empty before the mounting. Normally, this will result in an
	error.

	--read-only, --readonly, --ro, -r: Mount as read-only.
	
	--password-file=<file>, -p <file>: Specifies the path to a text file
	containing the password instead of manually entering it at $APP's
	prompt. The password needs to be stored as a single line of text,
	correctly terminated with a newline. Instead of a file, the path to a
	FIFO can also be specified instead. In this case, the password will be
	read from the FIFO and must also be terminated with a newline before
	EOF. Caveat: This option does not work when setting up an encrypted
	directory - only afterwards when it already exists. One has therefore
	to enter the password manually for the first time; after that this
	option can be used to specify a path to the file containing the
	password.
	
	--kmod-unload, -K: This option has an effect only when unmounting an
	already-mounted encfs directory. If this option is specified and if
	the "fuse" kernel module is not required any longer after unmounting
	the encrypted filesystem, $APP will attempt to unload the kernel
	module. This requires that "sudo rmmod fuse" has been set up by the
	administrator to actually work.
	
	--dry-run, -n: Show what would be done, but don't actually do
	anything. Caveat: This refers only to the actual encryption mount
	command. Preparatory steps like creating missing directories or
	required symlinks will still be performed for real.

	$APP will mount the encfs directory unless already mounted; in the
	latter case, it will unmount the directory instead (but only if the
	--force option is also provided in order to avoid creating mount point
	directories accidentally).

	Before trying to mount the encfs container directory, $APP will load
	the "fuse" kernel module if it is not already loaded. This requires
	that "sudo modprobe fuse" has been set up by the administrator to
	actually work.

	Note that encfs might possibly not to be fully trusted, because it has
	been built on some questionable design decisions such as CBC chaining
	mode and a rather restricted set of encryption algorithms.

	It is therefore recommended to never use encfs on its own for really
	important sensitive data, but rather on top of an already encrypted
	volume (such as LUKS or TrueCrypt).

	In such scenarios, encfs can add an additional layer of security on
	top of the already encrypted volumes. Encfs has also the advantage
	that it works on a per-user basis and does not require administrator
	rights for mounting or unmounting.
