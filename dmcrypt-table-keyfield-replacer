# Replaces all hexadecimal key fields in all dmsetup "crypt" table entries
# with new full-entropy keys.
#
# This can be used to refresh keys after some time, or replace keys which
# might have been compromised. Another usage is to create new keys using the
# original ones as templates when cloning a whole-system image where the clone
# shall use different keys.
#
# The entropy for the new keys will be obtained by calling an external helper
# executable "$truerand" (see the definition below for its actual name).
#
# This helper expects a decimal octet count (octets are 8-bit bytes) as its
# only argument and shall write that many binary full-entropy true-random
# octets (i.e. not just cryptographically secure pseudorandom-octets) to
# standard output.
#
# If no such executable exists, it is also possible to temporarily define a
# shell function with this name and "export -f" it before calling THIS script.
#
# This script can either be used as a filter where it reads dmsetup table
# contents from standard input, replaces the keys of any "crypt" lines, and
# writes the modified tables to standard output.
#
# Or a bunch of files can be specified as arguments, containing the stored
# contents of dmcrypt tables. In this case, for every argument a new file with
# ".new" added to the original filename will be created, containing a copy of
# the original file except that all keys will have been replaced with new
# ones.
