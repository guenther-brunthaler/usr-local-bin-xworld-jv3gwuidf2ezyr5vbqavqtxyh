$APP - replacement for "write" as local text-chat with readline support

Usage:
	$APP -s [ <client2inform> ]
	$APP -c <server2contact>

$APP is an alternative to using "write" for chatting with another user
(or with oneself in a different terminal) on the same machine.

The advantage over "write" is that $APP provided readline editing support,
including an editing history during the chat.

Options:

-s [ <client2inform> ]: Initiate a chat, creating a pty. The client needs the
know the pty device in order to connect to the chat server. If <client2inform>
is missing, the pty is just printed to stdout and the initiator has to relay
this information somehow to the client (e. g. by mail). If <client2inform> is
present and contains a "/", it is assumed to be a path to the client's tty. In
this case, a message will be written to that tty, informing the client how to
connect to the chat. Otherwise, <client2inform> is assumed to be the client's
user name on the local machine, and "write" will be used to inform the client
how to connect to the chat.

-c <server2contact>: Connect to an existing chat as a client, specifying the
chat server's pty device path as the argument.

-h: Display this help
-V: Display version info

SECURITY CAVEAT:

This is *not* a secure chat. EVERYONE from the local machine can connect to a
running chat server, pretending to be the chat buddy who the chat originator
is expecting to connect. Be aware of that risk!

PGP signed text should be pasted into the chat console where authenticity of
the sent information is important.

Also note that "write" has exactly the same security limitations; everyone can
write a message to the victim's tty pretenting to be created by "write" on
behalf of a different user.

If the "$APP" script is not installed, the following command
