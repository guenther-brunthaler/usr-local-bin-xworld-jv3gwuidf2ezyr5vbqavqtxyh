# Generate a base-62 password: 256 bits without arguments, or 128 bits
# otherwise.
#
# Uses neither /dev/random nor /dev/urandom, because both cannot guarantee any
# entropy any longer since Linux changed /dev/random in 2020 and made it
# basically the same as /dev/urandom.
#
# Instead, another script is used for providing the entropy, which gathers
# entropy using the HAVEGE algorithm and in addition uses a hardware random
# number generator, if one is available.
