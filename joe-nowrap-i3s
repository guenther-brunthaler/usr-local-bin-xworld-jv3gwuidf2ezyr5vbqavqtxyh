# 'joe' editor wrapper for hard-wrapped source files with 3-space indentation.
#
# This is the authorâ€™s favorite setting. It also seems to be popular with C++
# engineers at IBM. The indentation is clearly visible, yet still allows a lot
# of indentation levels before the line width is exhausted.
#
# Indentation inserts space characters instead of horizontal tabulation
# characters, which will make the text display the same way (and thus
# consistently) no matter what tabulation width may have been set in someone's
# editor or terminal.
#
# The enabled hard-wrapping is just a safety measure, informing the programmer
# that she just attempted to exceed the 79th column in a source-text line,
# which is generally disencouraged.
