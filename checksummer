	$APP - create, update or verify checksum files for files or
	directories.
	
	Usage: $APP [ options ] [ <1st_file_or_dir> ... ]
	
	$APP processes all of its arguments in the specified order. The
	arguments can either be files or directories.
	
	What $APP does for each argument depends on the mode $APP is run in:
	Checksum files might be created, verified or both.
	
	If an argument is a file, a single checksum file is created for it,
	sharing the same basename but an additional filename extension.
	
	If the argument is a directory, only a single checksum file will be
	created for all the files in that directory (including files in nested
	subdirectories). This single checksum file will have the same basename
	as the directory augmented with with an additional extension.
	
	Some typical examples for using $APP:
	
	\$ $APP *
	
	This runs $APP in its default mode, "combined". It examines all files
	and directories which are not hidden. If checksum files exist for the
	encountered files or directories, they are verified. Otherwise, new
	checksum files will be created for every file and top-level
	subdirectory of the current directory. In the latter case, the
	subdirectories are scanned recursively, and all files found will be
	added to the single checksum file for that subdirectory tree.
	
	Note that the wildcard * will match the checksum files as well as the
	files the checksums refer to.
	
	$APP is clever enough to deal with this: If both a file and its
	checksum file are specified in the command line, $APP will realize
	this and process the file just once.
	
	$APP also detects if the same file has been specified literally
	multiple times; in that case the duplicate arguments will silently be
	ignored.
	
	\$ $APP -r *
	
	This works identically as the example before, except for top-level
	subdirectories. Instead of creating a single checksum file containing
	all the directories' contents, $APP processes the directories
	recursively and creates separate checksum files for each normal file
	found within the subdirectory tree.
	
	\$ $APP *.iso
	
	This processes all files with extension ".iso" in the current
	directory. (Assuming there are no subdirectories which have names that
	also end with ".iso").
	
	\$ $APP -W '*.iso' *
	
	This is similar, but will also search for .iso files in any
	subdirectories. The "*" just selects the files and directories in the
	current directory where to start looking for .iso files.
	
	\$ $APP -W '*.mkv' -W '*.avi' *
	
	This demonstates how to search for more than one pattern. If any of
	the pattern is matched, the file will be selected for processing.
	
	
	Modes of operation:
	
	Creation mode - Create all checksum files unconditionally.
	Pre-existing checksum files will be overwritten without any warning.
	
	Verification mode - A checksum file for each argument is required and
	its contents will be verified. Missing checksum files will be
	displayed as errors. It is also possible to pass checksum files as
	arguments; in those cases all the files listed within the checksum
	files must exist and will be verified.
	
	Update mode - Like creation mode, but pre-existing checksum files will
	assumed to be valid and up-to-date if their modification time is not
	older than any of the files listed in the checksum file. If files
	which actually exist and should be checksummed are missing from the
	checksum files, or if the checksum file lists files which no longer
	exist, the checksum file will be considered outdated and will be
	regenerated.
	
	Combined mode - Like verification mode for arguments for which
	checksum files already exist; like creation mode otherwise. This is
	the default mode. Arguments which are passed as the names of checksum
	files will never be created, however - for such arguments verification
	mode is enforced.
	
	Deletion mode - all selected checksum files are removed. The command
	line arguments can specify the checksum files to be removed directly.
	or they can specify the files/directories for which any existing
	checksum files will be removed. In no case this mode will delete
	normal files that are not checksum files. However, the decision what a
	checksum file is and what not is solely based on the file extension.
	So, if you should be foolish enough to create a normal file which has
	the same file extension as checksum files, and you specify the name of
	this file (or its name with the file extension stripped), it *will* be
	deleted without further ado. You have been warned!
	
	Optional recursive operation:
	
	Normally, the modes of operation explained in the previous section
	will only process arguments which have been directly specified on the
	command line. If directories are passed as arguments, a single
	checksum file will be created for all the contents within that
	directory.
	
	However, sometimes it is better to create separate checksum files for
	all the files encountered within a directory and its subdirectories.
	$APP can optionally enable this behavior by enabling the "recursive"
	sub-mode by specifying the -r option.
	
	With recursive sub-mode active, all modes of operation will be
	modified to transcend into directories which have been specified as
	command line arguments and to recursively transcend into any
	subdirectories found there as well. However, symlinks will not be
	followed.
	
	Within each transcended directory, all normal files will be processed
	as if they had been specified on the command line when running $APP
	from within the directory.
	
	It is possible to restrict which files will be selected during
	recursive subdirectory processing, by specifying one or more -R
	options. Each -R option specifies a regular expression which will be
	matched against the path of the file. The path will be based on the
	command line argument which turned out to be a directory. For
	instance, if you ran $APP like this
	
	\$ $APP -r ../../bananadir
	
	then the patch to be matched against the regular expression might be
	something like "../../bananadir/subdir/deepersubdir/file.txt".
	
	If -R is not used, every file in the directory is matched. The regular
	expression will never be matched against directories, as those are
	always processed in recursive mode.
	
	-R implies -r, and "-r" is actually short for "-R '.*'", i. e. it
	matches everything.
	
	For cases where the full power of regular expressions is not needed,
	$APP also supports the -W option for pattern matching which uses a
	simplified syntax: Instead of a regular expression, the argument is a
	pattern which contains literal text and may contain the
	wildcard-characters "?" and "*".
	
	"?" matches any single character except for "/", and "*" matches any
	number (including 0) of characters except for "/". The pattern may
	include "/"-characters and will be matched against full path
	compoments at the end of the path. Examples of patterns: "*", "*.c",
	"include/*.h".
	
	The -R and -W options can be intermixed freely in the same $APP
	invocation, and may be specified multiple times.
	
	Output:
	
	$APP will write all sorts of diagnostic output to the standard error
	stream. If any failures should be encountered during processing, $APP
	will write a list of those to the standard output stream. This means
	one can easily redirect standard error to /dev/null and still see the
	list of failures (if any).
	
	Return value:
	
	The return value of $APP indicates success if no failures have been
	dectected. Otherwise, the return value of $APP will indicate failure
	and a non-empty list of failures will be written to the standard
	output stream.
	
	Checksum algorithms:
	
	Right now, $APP only supports MD5 checksums and will use the 'md5sum'
	tool to do the actual work of creating or verifying checksum files.
	Checksum files have the same base name as the file or directory which
	has been checksummed, augmented by the additional file extension
	'.md5'.
	
	Note that the MD5 algorithm is no longer supposed to be secure for
	cryptographic applications. The focus of $APP lies in media corruption
	detection, however, and not in detection of malicious modifications.
	
	For the former purpose, MD5 is still appropriate.

	Options:

	-b: Creation mode ("build", "create [B]inary checksums"). $COMPAT\n
	-c: Verification mode ("check"). $COMPAT\n
	-u: Update mode.\n
	-C: Combined mode. This is the default mode.\n
	-d: Deletion mode.\n
	-r: Modify modes to operate in recursive sub-mode. In every
	subdirectory encountered, all normal files will be processed.\n
	-R <regex>: Like -r, but allows to specify a regular expression for
	selecting files in subdirectories during recursive processing. Any
	number of regular expressions can be specified by specifying multiple
	-R options. The syntax for regular expression is the same as for the
	"sed" utility.\n
	-W: This works like -R, but supports a simplified syntax like "*",
	"*.c" or "include/*.h".\n
	-N <pri>: Set "niceness"-priority for $APP. Defaults to "$NICE". Has
	no effect if the "nice" utility is not found. -N "" disables the
	default and does not change the niceness priority.\n
	-I "<class>", -I "<class>:<classdata>":	Set "I/O niceness" for $APP.
	Defaults to "$IONICE". Has no effect if the "ionice" utility is not
	found. -I "" disables the default and does not change the niceness
	priority.\n
	-i: "Idle time procesing". Uses preset values for the -N and -I
	options in order to run $APP with the lowest possible priority,
	I/O-wise and CPU-wise. Use this if the normal defaults keep the system
	too busy and make it respond too slow.\n
	-h: Show this help.\n
	-V: Show only the version information.\n
